Real time implementation tips:

-> always browse "https://console.cloud.google.com" instead of searching GCP console
-> "https://status.cloud.google.com" - for resource status in gcp project
-> if you get access to a custom gcp project go and check the gcp projet in All tabs instead of recent tab of project
-> when presenting a demo to a customer make sure you change the PROJECT NAME to CUSTOMER-A to have a personal experience

Examination tips:

-> project-id  - name-sufix(number) - by deafult google make it unique globally
-> Location - No organization for free trail
