Real time implementation tips:

-> always browse "https://console.cloud.google.com" instead of searching GCP console
-> "https://status.cloud.google.com" - for resource status in gcp project
-> if you get access to a custom gcp project go and check the gcp projet in All tabs instead of recent tab of project
-> when presenting a demo to a customer make sure you change the PROJECT NAME to CUSTOMER-A to have a personal experience

Examination tips:
-> region ends with numeric
-> zone ends with alaphabet
-> One Env in on-perm == one project (project-dev)(prooject-prod)


Project Creation:

-> Project name - for identifing (human readable) it can be changed n times after creation also
-> project-id  - name-sufix(number) - by deafult google make it unique globally
-> Location - No organization for free trail

Project deletion:

-> goto project setting -> click on "shutdown" (A soft deleteionof project for 30 days within this time u can restart u project)
-> If you goto Manged resources u can fine the history of project and project need to be deleted in 30days

Access GCP Resources:

1. Google-CLoud-Storage: consider it as a Utility in House.

2. Compute Enginbe - API 
   -> when you enabled API you get the service account of the vm with project number prefix to its email.
      so always keep your project id private (not to expose)
   -> VM must be a part of a Data Center i.e, Zone
   -> There isno need of creation of keys as like in AWS for VM login
   -> Always stop tor delete the resource if no longer used
