Real time implementation tips:

-> always browse "https://console.cloud.google.com" instead of searching GCP console
-> "https://status.cloud.google.com" - for resource status in gcp project
-> if you get access to a custom gcp project go and check the gcp projet in All tabs instead of recent tab of project

Examination tips:
-> region ends with numeric
-> zone ends with alaphabet

Project Creation:

-> Project name - for identifing (human readable)
-> project-id  - name-sufix(number) - by deafult google make it unique globally
-> Location - No organization for free trail
