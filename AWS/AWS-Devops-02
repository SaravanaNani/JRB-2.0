                  Client-Server Architecture concept
=============================================================================

what is a client? 

- anything which request a Resource is a client
  for eg: Bowser (client) - gooogle.com(resource)
- clinet (Always asking)

what is a server?

- anything which respond to the resource for client
- Server (Always Responding)

- The client server must be in a same N/w for communication
- The N/W componets is a called as device

There are [3] Different Types of Client-Server Architechture: 1-Tier
                                                              2-Tier 
                                                              3-Tier

What is Production Env?


============================================================================

                                 1-Tier Architecture: 

- Client and Server in same Device ( devloper code runs in a local host and browse the app in same local host)
- only one layer, Therefore Not accessable by public

                                 2-Tier Architecture:

- client and Server on different Device (2layers) 
- we have multiple client layer (all browser like google.com)
- In server layer at bottom we have [Hardware] and on top of the Hardware we have [OS] on Top on OS we have [Application].
  and also lets assume we have Database on top on OS along with Application
- All multiple clinet connects the server - now here our server have 4Gb ram and 2cpu and 50GB HDD
- Now There Will be conflit of allocating of storage/RAM for the Application and Database - to Respond the client
- So because of this capacity issues we prefer 3-tier Architecture

                                3-Tier Architecture:

- Here Each client - application - Database layer are kept in 3 different machine
- Any coustomer directly access the backend server then it is known as Production Env 
- Since

-> Application Server - The server which has application hosted is callec application server
-> Database server - The server which has database installed / the server where data is stored is called Database Server.

- Every Devices communicate with each other in the N/W with IP and HostName
- IP = Internet Protocol = IP is unique identifier for a device in the N/W
- Hostname = Name of the server

                                N-tier Architecture

- Since the Application is devloped and the code must be secure we need to expose the application server in PVT-N/W
- To Allow the public to access the application we add-on another layer  web-server
- It is the recommended architecture for Production Environment.

- the n-tier containe following layers:

-> client layer - request a resource
-> Webserver - takes the request and redirect to Application Server
-> Application Server - The server which has application hosted is callec application server
-> Database server - The server which has database installed / the server where data is stored is called Database Server.

Types of Evnironment - Dev - QA - Pre-Prod - Prod
