                  Client-Server Architecture concept
=============================================================================

what is a client? 

- anything which request a Resource is a client
  for eg: Bowser (client) - gooogle.com(resource)
- clinet (Always asking)

what is a server?

- anything which respond to the resource for client
- Server (Always Responding)

- The client server must be in a same N/w for communication
- The N/W componets is a called as device

There are [3] Different Types of Client-Server Architechture: 1-Tier
                                                              2-Tier 
                                                              3-Tier

What is Production Env?


============================================================================

                                 1-Tier Architecture: 

- Client and Server in same Device ( devloper code runs in a local host and browse the app in same local host)
- only one layer, Therefore Not accessable by public

                                 2-Tier Architecture:

- client and Server on different Device (2layers) 
- we have multiple client layer (all browser like google.com)
- In server layer at bottom we have [Hardware] and on top of the Hardware we have [OS] on Top on OS we have [Application].
  and also lets assume we have Database on top on OS along with Application
- All multiple clinet connects the server - now here our server have 4Gb ram and 2cpu and 50GB HDD
- Now There Will be conflit of allocating of storage/RAM for the Application and Database - to Respond the client
- So because of this capacity issues we prefer 3-tier Architecture

                                3-Tier Architecture:
