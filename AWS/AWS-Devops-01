What is Devops ?

To start a project weneed SDLC for the project

=> SDLC - Lifecycle - process

Planning             - Define Goals, scope, resources and cost and risk etc.,
Requirment Analysis  - involves Gathering, analyzing and documenting functional and non functional requirments
Desgin               - Blue print for the appplication, user interface etc.,
Implement            - Devlopmet takes place as per requirment
Test                 - test the devloped code
Deploy               - releases the software to the users after through testing
Maintain             - Ensures the softwaare continues to operate as required.

How to implement SDLC we process ?

We have 3  models: 1. Waterfall Model - 1970 -> code everything, test and deploy
                   2. Agile Model - 2001 -> code, test and deploy every 2 weeks
                   3. DevOps - 2009 -> code, test and deploy continously

1. -> Waterfall Model: Linear sequential approach to managing software project. 
                       Each Phase depends on deliverables from the previous one. 

- Dev took-6 months to ddevelop code (meanwhile test and operation team are in chill mode)
- 6 months later dev give the code to Tester and he finds the bug 
- Now again the code got back word for development (devleoper)
- so its time taking process and the quality is low so we moved to Agile

2. -> Agile Model: Highly Dynamic and iterative approach. 
                   where you do not need the complete set of reuirments to start with
                   You can Develop some features and check customer response before takin the next step

- Coustomer requirment is divided into sprints ( 4-8 weeks is a sprint)
- after 2-4 sprint coustmer is asked to verify the release (requirment)
- Collection of Sprints is known as Release

3. -> Devops Model: Devops is a Agile methodology collaborating Development and operations.
                    it enables end to end lifecycle delivery of featurrs, fixes, updates at frequent intervals

- It is quicker and faster and continous i.e, Devloper dev-code - tester test-code - operations team deploy the cdoe and checks immediately
