How to implement SDLC we process ?

We have 3  models: 1. Waterfall Model - 1970
                   2. Agile Model - 2001
                   3. DevOps

1. -> Waterfall Model: Linear sequential approach to managing software project. 
                    Each Phase depends on deliverables from the previous one. 

- Dev took-6 months to ddevelop code (meanwhile test and operation team are in chill mode)
- 6 months later dev give the code to Tester and he finds the bug 
- Now again the code got back word for development (devleoper)
- so its time taking process and the quality is low so we moved to Agile
